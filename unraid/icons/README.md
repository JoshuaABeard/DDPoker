# DD Poker Unraid Icons

## Required Icons

### ddpoker.png (Application Icon)
- **Size:** 120x120 pixels
- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Source:** Extract from `code/poker/src/main/resources/config/poker/images/logo.png`
- **Process:** Resize to 120x120 pixels

### banner/ddpoker.png (Banner Image)
- **Size:** 560x95 pixels
- **Format:** PNG
- **Create:** Professional banner with DD Poker branding

## TODO

The icon images need to be created from the source logo. You can use image editing software to:

1. Open `code/poker/src/main/resources/config/poker/images/logo.png`
2. Resize to 120x120 pixels for the app icon
3. Create a 560x95 pixel banner image with DD Poker branding
4. Save both as PNG files in the appropriate directories

Alternatively, these can be generated programmatically using ImageMagick or similar tools.
