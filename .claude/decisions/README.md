# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Records of significant technical decisions. Read relevant ADRs before working in related areas to avoid re-litigating settled choices.

**Format:** `ADR-NNN-short-title.md`

**When to create an ADR:**
- Choosing between multiple valid approaches
- Decisions that would be non-obvious to a future agent
- Technology/library/pattern choices
- Decisions to NOT do something

**When NOT needed:**
- Trivial implementation choices
- Decisions already obvious from the code
- Bug fixes
